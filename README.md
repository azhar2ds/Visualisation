###MATPLOTLIB###

matplotlib is a Python-based plotting library with full support for 2D and limited support for 3D graphics, widely used in the Python scientific computing community. The library targets a broad range of use cases. It can embed graphics in the user interface toolkit of your choice, and currently supports interactive graphics on all major desktop operating systems using the GTK+, Qt, Tk, FLTK, wxWidgets and Cocoa toolkits. It can be called interactively from the interactive Python shell to produce graphics with simple, procedural commands, much like Mathematica, IDL or MATLAB. matplotlib can also be embedded in a headless webserver to provide hardcopy in both raster-based formats like Portable Network Graphics (PNG) and vector formats like PostScript, Portable Document Format (PDF) and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) that look great on paper.







###SEABORN###
Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures.

Here is some of the functionality that seaborn offers:

1 > A dataset-oriented API for examining relationships between multiple variables
2 > Specialized support for using categorical variables to show observations or aggregate statistics
3 > Options for visualizing univariate or bivariate distributions and for comparing them between subsets of data
4 > Automatic estimation and plotting of linear regression models for different kinds dependent variables
5 > Convenient views onto the overall structure of complex datasets
6 > High-level abstractions for structuring multi-plot grids that let you easily build complex visualizations
7 > Concise control over matplotlib figure styling with several built-in themes
8 > Tools for choosing color palettes that faithfully reveal patterns in your data
